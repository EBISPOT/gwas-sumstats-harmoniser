Hi! Thanks for using the GWAS Catalog harmonisation pipeline. 

If you need help with setting up the pipeline, configuration options, or have questions about gwas summary statistic data generally, the best place to ask is:

* GitHub discussions: https://github.com/EBISPOT/gwas-sumstats-harmoniser/discussions

We prefer a public discussion forum instead of answering emails, so other people interested in harmonisation pipeline can find and learn from our discussions.

However, if you prefer to report an issue here, please feel free to continue.
